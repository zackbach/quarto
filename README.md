# Quarto Board Game
[Quarto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarto_(board_game)) is a two-player impartial board game with perfect information similar to tic-tac-toe. Players take turns placing pieces with four different characteristics onto a 4x4 grid. The winner is the player who can place a piece to complete a row, column, or diagonal such that all four pieces in that line share at least one characteristic. However, you cannot choose the piece that you play—your opponent selects your piece, and vice-versa.
